Ah finally I found the half part of the flag for a challenge! Now I can send it to my friend
who has another half part and we'll both enter the top 10 of the competition! 

Damn man, the internet is so slow today, and mail is so bugged. 

Wait what? Why did he send me a gif? And why is he shouting at me for sending a gif?
I swear I sent him a photo. Please help me get the flag!

TL;DR You are given two gifs that contain information for finding half part of a string each. Find the complete
string and wrap it inside 'YoS{}' to get the flag.
